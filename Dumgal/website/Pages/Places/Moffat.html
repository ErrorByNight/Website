       <td>Originally established in Moffat's old bakehouse, Moffat Museum provides a fascinating insight into the town's history - from early Roman times, the Border Reivers, the heyday of its coaching era, to the discovery of the Well and Moffat's popularity as a spa town.</td>
       <td>There's something to see whatever time of year you visit. Look for the richly coloured insects, dragonflies, butterflies and bumblebees in the wildflower meadow in spring and early summer, the wading birds, Curlew, Snipe and Lapwing in winter or the Little Grebe, Geese and Mute Swans feeding on the lochan all year round.</td>
       <td>
           Moffat is a former spa town lying on the River Annan, with a population of around 2,500. It was a centre of the wool trade across the region as well as being a former spa centre. Within the town the Star Hotel, a mere 20 ft (6 m) wide claims to be the narrowest hotel in the world. Famous for moffat toffee.</td></tr>
